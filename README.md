Technical Projects I've Completed:

**[Hawksbill](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hi-hawksbill-conservation/id1506077566?platform=iphone)** <br> 
Developed an iOS app in partnership with the Hawaii Association for Marine Education & Research that crowdsources for research data on endangered marine animals for entry into photo-ID catalogs supporting population and behavioral research with a Heroku website for data collection and visualization. Available on App Store.

**Courtroom** <br>
Built a React Native legal services marketplace app with a Firebase backend with two other team members aimed at connecting low-income individuals with pro-bono lawyers and public defenders based on personal legal needs. Built as a group personal project with the Mobile Developers of Berkeley.

**Intelligent Pac-Man** <br>
Built (BFS, DFS, cost function, and A*) search algorithms, (Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, & Expectimax) decision-making algorithms, localization, mapping, SLAM using a SAT solver, inference, Q-learning, and other algorithms for Pac-Man in the CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

**CS61Cpu** <br>
Built a fully functional CPU with a RISC-V data path in the Logism circuit simulator capable of running machine code converted from RISC-V assembly code for the CS61C: Computer Architecture course. Implemented different stages from the data path and pipelining to increase throughout.
  
**Hashtag Sentiment Analysis** <br>
Worked with one other team member analyzing content using AWS Comprehend
collected with the Twitter API. Voted to receive a $300 award at MDB’s 2022 Tech Fair sponsored by Google & Retool.

**Cook County Housing Analysis** <br>
Analyzed housing dataset in Cook County, Illinois for Data Science course. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data and inform modeling decisions. Implemented a data processing pipeline using pandas, and built a linear model with scikit-learn to predict housing prices using feature engineering. 

**CS61B, The Game** <br>
Built an engine that develops a pseudorandom explorable 2D tile-based map for the CS61B course.

**Gitlet** <br>
Built a basic version control system that can add, commit, checkout, branch, and merge for the CS61B course.
